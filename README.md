# 1D-CNN and Residual BiLSTM Networks that Fuse Attention for Human Activity Recognition
The repository provides a tensorflow implementation of the method described in the paper.
We propose a one-dimensional convolution and a residual bidirectional LSTM network structure combined with attention, which can be used for behavior recognition of wearable sensing devices.
