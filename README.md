# 1D-CNN and Residual BiLSTM Networks that Fuse Attention for Human Activity Recognition
The repository provides a tensorflow implementation of the method described in the paper.  

We propose a one-dimensional convolution and a residual bidirectional LSTM network structure combined with attention, which can be used for behavior recognition of wearable sensing devices.  The structure diagram of the model is as follows:
